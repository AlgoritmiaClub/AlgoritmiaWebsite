# Homepage Section Plan: Mission & Vision

**Date:** September 9, 2025

This document outlines the plan for designing and integrating a new "Mission and Vision" section into the Algoritmia Club website's homepage.

---

### 1. Architectural Placement

*   **Location:** The new section will be added to the main homepage file (`/src/app/page.tsx`).
*   **Positioning:** It will be placed immediately after the `<HeroSection />` and before the `<SuccessStoriesGallery />`.
*   **Rationale:** This placement creates a strong narrative flow. It introduces the user to the club's core purpose right after the main headline and just before presenting the evidence of its success (the success stories).

### 2. Component-Based Design

*   **New Component:** A new, self-contained, and reusable React component will be created at `/src/components/home/MissionVisionSection.tsx`.
*   **Rationale:** This adheres to the project's component-based architecture, ensuring the homepage remains modular, clean, and easy to maintain.

### 3. Visual Layout & Styling (using Tailwind CSS)

*   **Layout:** The section will feature a responsive two-column grid (`grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-12`).
    *   On medium screens and larger, "Our Mission" and "Our Vision" will appear side-by-side.
    *   On mobile screens, the two columns will stack vertically to ensure readability.
*   **Visual Elements:**
    *   **Icons:** Each column will be headed by a distinct, minimalist SVG icon to provide a quick visual cue. These will be sourced from a high-quality open-source icon library (e.g., Heroicons) to match the site's professional aesthetic.
        *   **Mission Icon:** A target or rocket icon.
        *   **Vision Icon:** A telescope or mountain peak icon.
    *   **Typography:** Each column will have a prominent heading (e.g., `<h2>Our Mission</h2>`) with a larger font size and bold weight, followed by a concise descriptive paragraph in a standard font size.
*   **Background & Spacing:**
    *   The section will use a subtle, light gray background (e.g., `bg-gray-50`) to visually distinguish it from the sections above and below.
    *   Generous padding (e.g., `py-16`) will be applied to ensure the content is well-spaced and does not feel cramped.

### 4. Content Strategy

*   **Source:** For the initial implementation, the mission and vision text will be hardcoded directly into the `MissionVisionSection` component.
*   **Rationale:** This content is considered static and is not expected to change frequently, making a Markdown file or database entry unnecessary for the MVP.

### 5. Integration Steps

1.  Create the new file `/src/components/home/MissionVisionSection.tsx`.
2.  Implement the component with the two-column layout, icons, and hardcoded text.
3.  Import the `MissionVisionSection` component into `/src/app/page.tsx`.
4.  Place the `<MissionVisionSection />` tag between the `<HeroSection />` and `<SuccessStoriesGallery />` components.
