# Project Progress Report

**Date:** September 9, 2025

This document summarizes the development progress of the Algoritmia Club website, covering the completion of Phases 1, 2, and 3.

## Phase 1: Data Layer - Members (Complete)

**Goal:** Build and test the complete backend logic for fetching and processing member data.

**Outcome:** A robust, decoupled, and fully tested data layer for members is now in place, following the principles of Clean Architecture.

### Key Tasks Completed:

1.  **Domain Entity:**
    *   Defined the core `Member` interface in `/src/lib/domain/member.ts`.

2.  **Repository Interface:**
    *   Established the data access contract by creating the `IMemberRepository` interface in `/src/lib/infrastructure/repositories/IMemberRepository.ts`.

3.  **Markdown Repository Implementation:**
    *   Created the `MarkdownMemberRepository` in `/src/lib/infrastructure/repositories/MarkdownMemberRepository.ts`.
    *   This class is responsible for reading and parsing member data from `.md` files located in the `/content/members` directory.
    *   Implemented robust error handling to prevent site crashes from malformed files.

4.  **Unit Testing:**
    *   Wrote comprehensive unit tests for the `MarkdownMemberRepository` using `vitest`.
    *   The tests verify correct data parsing, handling of optional fields, and graceful failure for missing or invalid files.

5.  **Application Layer:**
    *   Defined the `MemberDTO` to shape data for the UI.
    *   Created the `getAllMembers` and `getMemberById` use cases in `/src/lib/application/use-cases/` to orchestrate data flow.

6.  **Service Locator:**
    *   Configured the service locator in `/src/lib/infrastructure/repositories/index.ts` to provide the `MarkdownMemberRepository` instance to the application, fully decoupling the UI from the data source.

## Phase 2: UI - Talent Directory Page (Complete)

**Goal:** Develop the complete, user-facing Talent Directory page.

**Outcome:** A fully interactive and responsive Talent Directory page is live at the `/talent` route.

### Key Tasks Completed:

1.  **Page Creation & Data Fetching:**
    *   Created the main page file at `/src/app/talent/page.tsx` as a React Server Component.
    *   Successfully fetched member data using the application layer use case from Phase 1.

2.  **Component Development:**
    *   Built a suite of reusable React components in `/src/components/talent/`:
        *   `TalentCard`: Displays a single member's profile.
        *   `TalentGrid`: Arranges member cards in a responsive grid.
        *   `MemberModal`: A pop-up dialog for viewing detailed member information.
        *   `TalentDirectory`: A client-side component (`'use client'`) that wraps the grid and modal to manage state.

3.  **Interactive Features:**
    *   **Search:** Implemented a real-time search bar that filters members by name, role, or skills.
    *   **Modal View:** Clicking on a `TalentCard` now opens the `MemberModal` with the selected member's full biography and skill set.

4.  **Styling:**
    *   Applied utility-first styles using **Tailwind CSS** to all components to create a clean, modern, and professional look consistent with the wireframes.

## Phase 3: Data Layer & UI - Home Page (Complete)

**Goal:** Build the home page, which includes implementing the data layer for "Success Stories."

**Outcome:** The website now has a compelling homepage that serves as a strong entry point, featuring a hero section and a gallery of featured success stories.

### Key Tasks Completed:

1.  **Data Layer (Success Stories):**
    *   Repeated the Clean Architecture process for `SuccessStory` data.
    *   Defined the `SuccessStory` entity, `ISuccessStoryRepository` interface, and `MarkdownSuccessStoryRepository` implementation.
    *   Wrote unit tests to ensure the story repository is reliable.
    *   Created the `SuccessStoryDTO` and the `getFeaturedSuccessStories` use case, which correctly fetches data from both the story and member repositories to enrich the story DTOs.
    *   Updated the service locator to provide the `SuccessStory` repository.

2.  **Component Development:**
    *   Built the primary homepage components in `/src/components/home/`:
        *   `HeroSection`: A welcoming banner with clear calls-to-action.
        *   `SuccessStoryCard`: A card to display a member's quote and new role.
        *   `SuccessStoriesGallery`: A section to display a grid of featured stories.

3.  **Homepage Integration:**
    *   Updated the root `page.tsx` to be a Server Component that fetches featured stories and renders the new homepage components.

4.  **Navigation:**
    *   Created a primary `Navbar` component in `/src/components/layout/`.
    *   Integrated the `Navbar` into the root `layout.tsx`, ensuring it appears on all pages for consistent site-wide navigation.

## Phase 4: Homepage Design Refinements (Complete)

**Goal:** Iteratively improve the design and interactivity of the homepage based on new ideas.

**Outcome:** The homepage now features more dynamic and polished animations and a richer layout.

### Key Tasks Completed:

1.  **Mission & Vision Section:**
    *   Designed and implemented a new `MissionVisionSection` component.
    *   This section was placed between the `HeroSection` and the `SuccessStories` to improve the narrative flow of the page.

2.  **Hero Section Animation:**
    *   Converted the `HeroSection` into a dynamic, animated Client Component.
    *   **Animation:** After a 2-second delay, the section animates from a full-width dark panel to a 50/50 split layout.
    *   **Faded Transition:** Implemented a "feathered edge" effect. The dark panel is now a `linear-gradient` that fades to transparent, creating a soft blend into the adjacent light panel instead of a hard edge.
    *   **Choreographed Reveal:** The logo on the right side is animated to fade in with a slight delay, making it appear as if it's being revealed by the background animation.

3.  **Team Photo Section:**
    *   Created a new `TeamPhotoSection` component.
    *   Added the full-width group photo to the very end of the homepage to serve as a closing visual.

4. **Sucess Stories Section:**
    *   Changed the success stories component from a grid view to a marquee.
