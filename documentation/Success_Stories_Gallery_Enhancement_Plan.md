# Plan: Success Stories Gallery Enhancements

**Date:** September 9, 2025

This document outlines two distinct development plans to enhance the `SuccessStoriesGallery` component on the homepage, transforming it from a static grid into a dynamic, horizontally-scrolling showcase.

## Option 1: Clickable Arrow Navigation (Carousel)

**Summary:** This approach converts the gallery into a classic carousel, where users click "Previous" and "Next" buttons to navigate through the story cards. This gives the user full control.

### Development Steps:

1.  **Convert to Client Component:**
    *   Modify `/src/components/home/SuccessStoriesGallery.tsx` by adding the `"use client";` directive at the top of the file.

2.  **Update State and Refs:**
    *   Import `useRef`, `useState`, and `useEffect` from React.
    *   Create a ref to hold the scrollable container: `const scrollContainerRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);`.
    *   Create state to manage the visibility of the navigation buttons: `const [showNav, setShowNav] = useState({ left: false, right: true });`.

3.  **Modify JSX and Layout:**
    *   The main container will be updated to `position: relative`.
    *   The `div` that currently has the `grid` class will be changed to a `flex` container. It will receive the `scrollContainerRef` and be styled for horizontal, smooth scrolling while hiding the scrollbar (e.g., `flex flex-row overflow-x-auto space-x-8 scroll-smooth scrollbar-hide`).
    *   Add two `<button>` elements for the left and right arrows. These will be positioned absolutely over the container on the left and right edges.

4.  **Implement Scroll Logic:**
    *   Create a `handleScroll` function that accepts a `direction` (`'left'` or `'right'`).
    *   This function will access `scrollContainerRef.current` and modify its `scrollLeft` property by a calculated amount (e.g., 80% of the container's visible width) to slide the content.

5.  **Manage Button Visibility:**
    *   Create a function to check the scroll state.
    *   This function will read the `scrollLeft`, `scrollWidth`, and `clientWidth` of the `scrollContainerRef` to determine if the user is at the beginning or the end of the scroll area.
    *   Use a `useEffect` hook to attach this check function to the container's `onScroll` event and also run it on window resize. The state (`showNav`) will be updated accordingly, and the `disabled` attribute on the buttons will be toggled based on this state.

6.  **Style Buttons:**
    *   Use Tailwind CSS to style the arrow buttons. They should be semi-transparent, becoming fully opaque on hover, and contain centered SVG arrow icons.

## Option 2: Continuous Automatic Scrolling (Marquee)

**Summary:** This approach transforms the gallery into a seamless, automatically scrolling marquee. It is visually dynamic and requires less user interaction.

### Development Steps:

1.  **Component Type:**
    *   No change is needed. `/src/components/home/SuccessStoriesGallery.tsx` can remain a performant Server Component.

2.  **Update JSX for Content Duplication:**
    *   Inside the component, before the `return` statement, create a new array that duplicates the `stories` prop: `const duplicatedStories = [...stories, ...stories];`.
    *   The component will now map over `duplicatedStories` to render the cards. This is essential for creating the seamless loop effect.

3.  **Modify Layout:**
    *   The main container will be updated to have `overflow: hidden`.
    *   The inner `div` that holds the mapped cards will be changed from a `grid` to a `flex` container. It will be assigned a custom animation class (e.g., `animate-scroll`).

4.  **Define CSS Animation:**
    *   Open the global stylesheet at `/src/app/globals.css`.
    *   Define a new `@keyframes` rule named `scroll`:
        ```css
        @keyframes scroll {
          from { transform: translateX(0); }
          to { transform: translateX(-50%); }
        }
        ```
    *   The `-50%` value is used because the content width has been doubled. This scrolls the entire length of the original content.

5.  **Configure Tailwind CSS:**
    *   Open the `tailwind.config.ts` file.
    *   Extend the `theme.animation` configuration to register the new `scroll` animation: `animation: { scroll: 'scroll 40s linear infinite' }`.
    *   The duration (`40s`) can be adjusted to control the scrolling speed.

6.  **Apply Animation and Hover Effect:**
    *   Apply the `animate-scroll` class to the inner flex container.
    *   To implement the pause-on-hover feature, wrap the gallery in a `div` with the `group` class. Then, on the animated element, add the utility class `group-hover:[animation-play-state:paused]`.
