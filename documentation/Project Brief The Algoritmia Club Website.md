# **Project Brief: The Algoritmia Club Website**

Version: 1.0  
Status: Approved for Development  
Date: September 8, 2025

## **1\. Introduction: What Are We Building?**

This document outlines the vision, goals, and scope for the official website of Club Algoritmia. We are building more than just a website; we are creating a professional, public-facing digital portfolio designed to showcase the exceptional talent within our club.

This platform will serve as the primary bridge between our members, the tech industry, and the next generation of aspiring student developers.

## **2\. The Opportunity: Why Are We Building This?**

Currently, our club's talent and achievements are known primarily through word-of-mouth. While effective, this limits our reach and potential. We lack a central, professional platform to:

* **Showcase our collective skill** to potential employers and recruiters.  
* **Tell our success stories** in a compelling way to inspire prospective members.  
* **Establish a credible and professional brand** for the club in the wider tech community.

A dedicated website solves these problems by creating a single source of truth for who we are, what we do, and the value we provide to our members and the industry.

## **3\. Our Guiding Principle**

Every decision for this project will be measured against a single, powerful guiding principle:

**"We design the site to impress recruiters, knowing that in doing so, we will inspire future members."**

This principle clarifies our priorities. By building a platform that meets the high standards of tech industry professionals, we inherently create a compelling case for why talented students should join us. Quality and professionalism are our best recruiting tools.

## **4\. Project Goals**

### **Primary Goal**

* **Showcase Talent:** To create a world-class public portfolio for Club Algoritmia members, highlighting their projects, skills, and professional readiness.

### **Secondary Goals**

* **Build a Bridge to Industry:** To create a clear and direct channel for tech recruiters and companies to discover and connect with our talent pool.  
* **Attract Top Student Talent:** To use our members' success as a powerful magnet to attract the most motivated and ambitious students to join the club.

## **5\. Target Audience**

We are building this website for two distinct audiences:

1. **Recruiters & Tech Professionals:** Our primary audience. They are looking for evidence of talent and have very little time. We must provide them with a clean, fast, and professional experience that allows them to quickly find our members' portfolios (GitHub, LinkedIn) and contact information.  
2. **Prospective Student Members:** Our secondary audience. They are looking for community, opportunity, and proof that joining the club is a valuable investment of their time. They will be inspired by seeing the success of current members and understanding the types of activities we offer.

## **6\. Scope: Key Features for Launch (MVP)**

To achieve our goals, the initial version of the website will include the following key sections:

* **Homepage:** A powerful first impression with a clear mission statement and direct links for our two main audiences.  
* **Talent Directory:** A professional, searchable gallery of member profiles, each with photos, key skills, and links to their professional portfolios.  
* **Success Stories:** A dedicated section featuring testimonials from members who have landed internships and jobs at top tech companies.  
* **About / Our Process:** An explanation of the club's activities, such as workshops, mock interviews, and collaborative projects.  
* **For Companies (Contact):** A clear and simple way for recruiters to get in touch with the club's leadership.

Features such as an internal member-only hub or a blog are considered out of scope for the initial launch but may be developed in a future "Phase 2."

The intended tech stack is Next.js + Tailwind CSS + Markdown + Vercel.
